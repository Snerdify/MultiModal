ðŸ› Multimodal AI is a new AI paradigm, in which various data types (image, text, speech, numerical data) are combined with multiple intelligence processing algorithms to achieve higher performances.

 ðŸ“¢Multimodal AI often outperforms single modal AI in many real-world problems.

 ðŸ¦©This repo contains development progress of my multimodal applications created using Flamingo and JINA .

 ðŸ”¨WIP. Will explore more Frameworks.

 Examples of Multimodal Tasks:
 1. Table Question Answering
 2. OCR
 3. Info extraction from scanned documents
 4. Video Classification / Summarization
 5. Visual question Answering
