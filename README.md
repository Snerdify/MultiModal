🛠Multimodal AI is a new AI paradigm, in which various data types (image, text, speech, numerical data) are combined with multiple intelligence processing algorithms to achieve higher performances.

 📢Multimodal AI often outperforms single modal AI in many real-world problems.

 🦩This repo contains development progress of my multimodal applications created using Flamingo and JINA .

 🔨WIP. Will explore more Frameworks.
